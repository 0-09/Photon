# Photon

Photon is a lightning fast web crawler which extracts URLs, files, intel & endpoints from a target.

Yep, I am using 100 threads and Photon won't complain about it because its in Ninja Mode :sunglasses:

## Why Photon?


#### Not Your Regular Crawler
Crawlers are supposed to recursively extract links right? Well that's kind of boring so **Photon** goes beyond that.
It extracts the following information:
- URLs (in-scope & out-of-scope)
- URLs with parameters (`example.com/gallery.php?id=2`)
- Intel (emails, social media accounts, amazon buckets etc.)
- Files (pdf, png, xml etc.)
- JavaScript files & Endpoints present in them
- Strings based on custom regex pattern

The extracted information is saved in an organized manner.\

#### Intelligent Multi-Threading
Here's a secret, most of the tools floating on the internet aren't properly multi-threaded even if they are supposed to. They either supply a list of items to threads which results in multiple threads accessing the same item or they simply put a thread lock and end up rendering multi-threading useless.\
But Photon is different or should I say "genius"? Take a look at [this](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/blob/38f64100d101fce897b4e0a5cfafdaeb129491d2/photon.py#L282-L293) and decide yourself.

#### Ninja Mode
In Ninja Mode, 3 online services are used to make requests to the target on your behalf.\
So basically, now you have 4 clients making requests to the same server simultaneously which gives you a speed boost, minimizes the risk of connection reset as well as delays requests from a single client.\
Here's a comparison generated by [Quark](https://github.com/s0md3v/Quark) where the lines represent threads:

### Usage

#### `-u --url`

Run Photon against a single website.

`python photon.py -u http://example.com`

Specifying a URL with it's schema i.e. `http(s)://` is optional but you **must** add `www.` if the website has it.

Tip :bulb: : If you feel like the crawling is taking too long or you just don't want to crawl anymore, just press `ctrl + c` in your terminal and Photon will skip the rest of URLs.

#### `-l --level`

Depth of crawling.

`python photon.py -u http://example.com -l 3`

Default Value: `2`

#### `-d --delay`

You can keep a delay between requests made to the target by specifying the time in seconds.

`python photon.py -u http://example.com -d 1`

Default Value: `0`

#### `-t --threads`

Number of threads to use.

`python photon.py -u http://example.com -t 10`

Default Value: `2`

Tip :bulb: : The optimal number of threads depends on your connection speed as well as nature of the target server. If you have a decent network connection and the server doesn't have any rate limiting in place, you can use up to `100` threads.

#### `-c --cookie`

Cookie to send.

`python photon.py -u http://example.com -c "PHPSSID=821b32d21"`

#### `-n --ninja`

Toggles Ninja Mode on/off.

`python photon.py -u http://example.com --ninja`

Default Value: `False`

#### `-s --seeds`

Lets you add custom seeds, seperated by commas.

`python photon.py -u http://example.com -s "http://example.com/portals.html,http://example.com/blog/2018"`

#### `-r --regex`

Specify custom regex pattern to extract strings.

`python photon.py -u http://example.com -r "\d{10}"`

The strings extracted using the custom regex pattern are saved in `custom.txt`.
